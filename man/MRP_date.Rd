\title{MRP_date: Mars Rover Photos - Querying by Earth date}
\usage{
MRP_date(key = Sys.getenv("NASA_TOKEN"), earth_date, camera = "all",
  page = 1, type = "curiosity", download_image = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{key}{String. Your NASA API key, you can enter your key in the function parameter, but it's not recommended. Instead, you'd better save your key in R environment and call it "NASA_TOKEN". Then the function would automatically acquire your key info.}

\item{earth_date}{Date. Earth date that you want to query photos with. Format should be "YYYY-MM-DD".}

\item{camera}{String. See detail camera list for abbreviations and availability. "all" as default.}

\item{page}{Integer. 25 items per page returned. 1 as default.}

\item{type}{String. "curiosity"/"opportunity"/"spirit". "curiosity" as default.}

\item{download_image}{Boolean. Download the first(default) image of returned list. FALSE as default.}
}
\value{
Info of Mars Rover photos (and downloaded image).
}
\description{
Each rover has its own set of photos stored in the database, which can be queried separately.
There are several possible queries that can be made against the API. Photos are organized by the sol
(Martian rotation or day) on which they were taken, counting up from the rover's landing date.
A photo taken on Curiosity's 1000th Martian sol exploring Mars, for example, will have a sol attribute of 1000.
If instead you prefer to search by the Earth date on which a photo was taken, you can do that too.
Along with querying by date, results can also be filtered by the camera with which it was taken and
responses will be limited to 25 photos per call. Queries that should return more than 25 photos will be
split onto several pages, which can be accessed by adding a 'page' param to the query.
