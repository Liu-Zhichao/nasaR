# nasaR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of nasaR is to provide useful functions to help access NASA data easily.

## Installation

1. You can install the released version of nasaR from [nasaR](https://github.com/Liu-Zhichao/nasaR) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Liu-Zhichao/nasaR")
```

2. You can get your own NASA API token at: [NASA_API_TOKEN](https://api.nasa.gov/).

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(nasaR)
## Download an high-definition astronomy picture of 2019/11/01 and return its explanation text as well.
APOD(date = as.Date("2019-11-01"), hd = TRUE, return_text = TRUE)
## Return info of technology which NASA is working on since 2016/01/01.
data <- Techport(update_since = as.Date("2016-01-01"))
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
